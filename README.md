List of papers related with SL.
Temporary the list of papers is contained in an excel file. It only contains the title of the papers. 
In the following days I will update the list and include further details, i.e., author list, year of publication, venue, etc.

The final goal is to include the list in the readme.

If you are interesting in this project.
